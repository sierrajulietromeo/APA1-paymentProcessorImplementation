# Payment Processor Implementation Examples
This repository demonstrates two different implementation approaches for a payment processing system using JavaScript: monolithic and modular.

## Monolithic

See `monolithic.js`.

### Pros of Monolithic

* Quick to set up and get running
* No need to manage imports/exports
* Easier to deploy as a single file
* Better for small projects or prototypes
* Simpler debugging (all code in one place)

### Cons of Monolithic

* Less maintainable as the codebase grows
* Harder to collaborate on (potential merge conflicts)
* No code separation/encapsulation
* More difficult to test individual components
* Less reusable components

## Modular

See inside the `modular` folder.

### Pros of Modular

* Better organisation and maintainability
* Easier to test individual components
* Better for team collaboration
* Clear separation of concerns
* More reusable components
* Easier to scale and extend
* Better encapsulation

### Cons of Modular

* More complex setup
* Need to manage imports/exports
* More files to manage
* Slightly more complex build process
* May be overkill for small projects
